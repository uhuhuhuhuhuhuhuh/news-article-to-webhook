# webhook-and-news-article
Is a repo that I had ChatGPT make the code which I myself have been using as a way to let some of my discord server members know whats going on

It works but since discord doesn't like when you send a lote of messages through a webhook it deletes it I made it so it's slower and keeps the webhook from dying 

(If you've never had this issue then it might have been the server I tested it on I Don't Know)
